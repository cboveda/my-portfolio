        quote: "Through my years of knowing Christopher Boveda he has never ceased to amaze me. The qualities that are often sought after in a team of professionals comes uniquely packaged into one individual with him: he is naturally gifted at picking up new skills and loves to get his hands dirty with end-to-end project development, and also looks to lift others up, with an innate ability to mentor and teach others. As a senior developer, I’ve worked with him to problem solve on projects that he’s working on in school and yet find myself learning something new with every interaction. He seeks now to dive into the software industry, ever searching for a new challenge and a new problem to fix. While I have not had the chance to work with him professionally, his raw intelligence, drive, and passion lead me to hope I’ll one day get the chance, and know that whatever team does get to work with him will be an endlessly lucky one."
